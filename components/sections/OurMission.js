              Hi I'm Andy 👋, founder of Third Pig Software.
            </p>
            <p>
              It happens too often:{' '}

            <p>
              You handover the reigns of your idea to a team of technical
              experts, who build and build and build, but miss the mark because
              they failed to understand your business right from the start.
            </p>
            <p>
              Third Pig was founded because I believe it doesn't have to be like this.
