            It happens too often: software teams promise a dream, but deliver a
            nightmare.

            You handover the reigns of your idea or concept to a team of
            technical experts, who build and build and build ðŸ”¨, but miss the
            mark because they failed to understand your business or the project
            requirements right at the beginning.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-2'>
            I started Third Pig because I believe that things simply don't have
            to be this way.

            <b>We believe in getting to know your business on a deep level</b>,
            knowing how things tick, knowing your goals and your ambitions; then
            helping you deliver the value you need to achieve them. ðŸš€
          </p>
          <p className='mt-2'>
            <b>We aren't yes people</b> - we'll challenge you as much as you
            challenge us. When you work with us, we'll try to do what's best for
            you as a customer and for the project, regardless of how that would
            impact our revenue.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-2'>
            We'll always highlight to you the simplest available solution and
            will always try to suggest something small over something that will
            allow us to invoice more.

            Above all else we believe in making our customers successful."
